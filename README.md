# An Analysis for a Kickstarter Campaign
## Overview of Project
  *The purpose of this project was to examine data and provide analysis to a client wishing to compare and contrast the results of campaigns similar to the clients own personal endeavors (That being, how "Theaters" and "Plays" campaign fared throughout the world).  Through the collection of data from various campaigns across the world from the years 2009 to 2017, this project was able to provide two analytical observations that helped the client better understand the outcomes based on the launch dates of these campaigns, as well as the outcomes of goals by these campaigns. Filters were used to adjust accordingly to the data most relevant to the client's preference for the campaign (Those filters being "Theaters" and "Plays", also "years grouped by months") .
 ### Analysis and Challenges
  1. **Analysis** -	As previously noted, the analysis stage of this project was obtainable through the data collected from previous campaigns. This data when implemented into our Kickstarter data set in Excel allowed for an in-depth observation in how these campaigns fared. Data sets such as the success rate, failed rate, and cancellation rate of certain campaigns help visualize and create an idea of an ideal campaign based on trends. The succession, failure, or cancellation of a campaign had a correlation to whether or not these campaigns met their intended monetary goal. The pledges made by doners determined if the goal was met.
